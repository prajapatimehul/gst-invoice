## Invoice Series

### DT-Series (Direct Clients)
- **Format**: DT-01, DT-02, DT-03...
- **Location**: `invoices/direct-clients/`
- **Starting**: DT-01

### GT-Series (Upwork Clients)
- **Format**: GT-01, GT-02, GT-03...
- **Location**: `invoices/upwork-clients/`
- **Numbering**: Continuous throughout the year (configurable starting number)

### üìã Invoice Numbering
- **GT-series continues throughout the year** (no quarterly reset)
- **Configurable starting number** in app settings
- Example: If you set starting number to 13, invoices will be GT-13, GT-14, GT-15...
- Track the last used number and set it as starting number for next batch
- **Sequential numbering** ensures no gaps in invoice series

---

## Key Rules

### Amounts
- **USE GROSS AMOUNTS** - The full billing amount before platform fees
- For Upwork: Use the gross earnings (NOT the net received amount)
- Example: $1,600 gross = Invoice shows $1,600 (not $1,438.40 after fees)
- Direct clients: Full invoiced amount

### One Invoice Per Client Per Month
- Each client gets ONE invoice per month
- Combine all work done for that client in the month
- Use month-end date or last work date as invoice date
- Track monthly totals per client

### Exchange Rates ‚≠ê UPDATED

**üö® CRITICAL FOR GST COMPLIANCE**: Each invoice must use the exchange rate for its specific invoice date!

#### NEW: Per-Invoice-Date Exchange Rates

The app now automatically fetches the correct exchange rate for EACH invoice's date:

**Example (Multi-Month CSV):**
- ABC Inch - July (Jul 25, 2025) ‚Üí Uses rate for Jul 25
- ABC Inch - August (Aug 29, 2025) ‚Üí Uses rate for Aug 29
- XYZ LLC - September (Sep 5, 2025) ‚Üí Uses rate for Sep 5

#### Two Modes:

**1. Manual Mode** (Recommended for Single-Month Batches)
- Enter ONE exchange rate in settings
- All invoices in batch use this rate
- Best for processing one month at a time
- Verify rate from [RBI Reference Rate Archive](https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/referenceratearchive.aspx)

**2. Auto Mode** (For Multi-Month CSVs)
- Leave exchange rate field empty
- App automatically fetches rate FOR EACH invoice date
- Uses frankfurter.app API (European Central Bank data)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: NOT official RBI rates, but close approximation
- Each invoice gets its own date-specific rate

#### RBI vs API Rates

**RBI Limitation:**
- ‚ùå No public API available from RBI or FBIL
- ‚úÖ Official source: Manual download from RBI website
- ‚úÖ For strict GST compliance: Download RBI rates, process month-by-month with manual entry

**frankfurter.app API:**
- ‚úÖ Automated per-date fetching
- ‚úÖ Based on European Central Bank data
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Close approximation but NOT official RBI rates
- ‚úÖ Suitable for multi-month processing

## PDF Generation

### Current Method (LibreOffice)
- Uses LibreOffice headless mode
- Command: `soffice --headless --convert-to pdf`
- Works but may have formatting differences from Excel

### Goal: Google Sheets Parity
- PDF should look exactly like Google Sheets export
- Need to ensure:
  - Same fonts and sizes
  - Proper alignment
  - Correct margins
  - No extra spacing
  - Clean borders

### Options to Explore
1. **Excel native export** (requires Excel on Mac)
2. **Google Sheets API** (upload ‚Üí export as PDF)
3. **Improved LibreOffice settings** (better page setup)
4. **Python PDF libraries** (render from Excel data)

---

## CA Submission Package

1. **Sales Invoices**
   - All DT-series PDFs (direct clients)
   - All GT-series PDFs (Upwork)

2. **Supporting Documents**

   - Exchange rate references

3. **Summary Report**
   - Total income (USD + INR)
   - Invoice list with dates
   - Client breakdown

---

## Commands

### Generate Invoice
```bash
# Interactive mode
python3 generate_invoice.py

# Direct client
python3 generate_invoice.py --type DT --client "ABC" --amount 5000

# Upwork client
python3 generate_invoice.py --type GT --client "XYZ - Upwork" --amount 3000
```

# Monthly invoices (one per client per month)
python3 parse_upwork_report.py report.csv --monthly

# Per-transaction invoices (not recommended)
python3 parse_upwork_report.py report.csv
```

### Convert Excel to PDF
```bash
# Single file
python3 generate_invoice.py --convert invoices/direct-clients/DT-01.xlsx

# Batch convert
for file in invoices/upwork-clients/*.xlsx; do
    python3 generate_invoice.py --convert "$file"
done
```

## Important Notes

### Upwork Amount Calculation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Always use GROSS amount (before Upwork fees)
- Upwork shows: Gross, Service Fee, WHT, Net
- Invoice uses: Gross amount only
- Your bank receives: Net amount
- CA needs to know: Gross = service value provided

### Yearly Sequential Numbering
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Invoice numbers CONTINUE throughout the year (no quarterly reset)
- **Configurable starting number** - Set in app settings before generating invoices
- No gaps in invoice numbers
- Track last used number and use it as starting number for next batch
- GT-series: Continuous sequence (e.g., GT-01, GT-02... GT-50, GT-51...)
- **Example for a year**:
  - January: GT-01, GT-02, GT-03
  - February: GT-04, GT-05, GT-06 (continues from previous month)
  - March: GT-07, GT-08, GT-09 (continues sequentially)
  - ...and so on throughout the year

### Date Format
- Always use: DD-MMM-YYYY
- Example: 15-Oct-2025, 04-Jul-25

### Client Names
- **Upwork CSV**: Uses "Agency" column for actual client company names (e.g., "ABC Inc", "XYZ LLC")
- **Invoice Display**: Automatically appends " - Upwork" suffix to client names
- **Example**: "ABC Inch - Upwork"
- Direct clients: Use actual company name
- Keep consistent across months

### Upwork CSV Field Mapping
- **Client Name**: Uses "Agency" field (not "Account Name")
- **Amount**: Uses "Amount $" field (gross amount before fees)
- **Transaction Types**: Only "Hourly" and "Fixed-price" transactions are processed
- **Grouping**: One invoice per client per month based on transaction dates
